This README file provides an overview of the data analysis performed on the Auto Theft Open Data dataset and the Python code used to conduct the analysis.

### Dataset Overview

The Auto Theft Open Data dataset contains information about auto theft incidents reported in a certain area. The dataset includes various fields such as the unique ID of each incident, the date and time of the report, the division where the offense occurred, the type of location, the premises type, and geographical coordinates.

### Code Overview

The Python code provided in this repository is used to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization on the Auto Theft Open Data dataset. Here's a brief overview of the code:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: The code starts by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and performing initial data cleaning tasks such as dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and converting data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The code conducts exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. It includes:

   - Analysis of theft incidents by year, month, day of the week, and hour.
   - Visualization of the distribution of theft incidents by police division, location type, premises type, and neighborhood.

3. **Data Visualization**: The code uses Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create various types of plots and visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

4. **Data Export**: The cleaned and processed dataset is exported to a CSV file named `clean.csv` for further analysis or integration with other tools.

### Usage

To use the provided code:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Download the Auto Theft Open Data dataset (CSV file) and place it in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script to execute the data analysis and visualization code.
4. Review the generated visualizations and analysis results to gain insights into the dataset.

### Conclusion

The analysis and visualizations provided by the code aim to help stakeholders understand patterns and trends in auto theft incidents, identify high-risk areas, and inform decision-making for crime prevention and law enforcement efforts.
